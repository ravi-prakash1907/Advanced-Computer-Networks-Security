# NS-2 Problems

NS2 or Network Simulator 2 is a tool to realize and understand networking concepts. It's not only used for understanding the basics of computer networks, but it's also very helpful while developing our own ideas or doing some research.  

_This directory holds some interesting practical network simulations implemented through NS2. These problems are given here:_  

> 1. [Problem-1: Simulate a network with 50 nodes where 10 nodes are dropping packets.](./problem1)  
> 2. [Problem-2: Simulate a wireless network with 100 nodes and analyze the trace file.](./problem2)
