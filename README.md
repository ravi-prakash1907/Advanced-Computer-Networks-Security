# Introduction

This branch of the repository is created to hold the projects developed during various courses and tutorials.  
All of these projects are tipically based on the networking concepts only. Along with that, most of them are centered around some of the security aspects, as well.  

### Idea from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)  
#### 1. [E-Mail Sender](emailSender.py)  
1. Before using this script, remember to update it with the actual **sender's** & **receiver's** email address.  
2. Save your password in [```src/password.txt```](src/password.txt)  
3. Save the desired message in [```src/message.txt```](src/message.txt)  
4. Run ```python3 emailSender.py``` for execution.  
5. _It's just for a very basic demonstration purpose! Use it on your own risk!!_  

#### 2. [DDoS Script](ddos.py)  
1. Replace the `target` with your **own** ip-address/url, where you want to test this script.  
2. Run ```python3 ddos.py``` for execution.  
3. This file is create for learning purpose, only!  
4. _**DDoS** (Distributed Denial of Service) **is a criminal offense!** Only you will be responsible if you use this script for any such purpose._  

#### 3. [Port Scanner](portScanner.py)  
1. Replace the `target` with your **own** ip-address/url, where you want to check for open ports.  
2. Run ```python3 portScanner.py``` for execution.  
3. This file is create for learning purpose, only!  
4. _**Public Port Scanning is a criminal offense!** Only you will be responsible if you use this script for any such purpose._  

#### 4. [TCP Chatroom](TCP%20Chatroom/)  
1. It demonstrates how a simple client-server architecture based chatroom works.  
2. Primarily made to access through terminal/command line.  
3. It works on **TCP** i.e. Transmission Control Protocol.  
4. Visit [here](TCP%20Chatroom/README.md) to know it's usage.
